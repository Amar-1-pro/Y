Compared with the traditional traditional industries, the IT industry develops and updates faster. Once it stops learning, it will soon be eliminated by the industry. However, we must be clear: the elimination is always only those practitioners at the primary level, and those who are skilled in technology. It is always scarce. Therefore, for learning, we still have to be down to earth.

Self-learning Python, too, don't start collecting various information websites because of your fever, buy various books, download a lot of teaching videos, and after a few days, the enthusiasm for learning begins to fade, and then a few weeks. , finally completed the study course - "from entry to give up." Therefore, learning Python requires one step at a time and learning in a down-to-earth manner.

FQ
Before I talk about how to get started with Python, personal advice is that everyone has their own FQ tools, use Google search more, look at the world outside the wall, and look at the open source projects on Github.

As for how to FQ, here are the tools I have used: FQ toolset

Python learning resource set
I believe that many people will find a variety of learning materials when they learn a programming language. To be honest, there is too much information, but it is useless. According to your own study habits, it is better to choose a resource to adhere to.

Because everyone's needs are different, here is a collection of Python better learning materials:

Python blog site resources
Getting started with Python
For the introduction, the main thing is to master the basic grammar and familiar with the programming specifications, so most of the tutorials are basically the same, so it is recommended to choose a tutorial that suits you and stick to it.

In Python getting started, I wrote a series of "Grassroots Python" blog, which is based on Python 3.6. The Python Getting Started series tutorial, for better reading, put it on GitBook ; if GitBook access is slow, you can also Personal blog review: Grassroots Python , I hope to help you get started with Python.

Django
There are many different web frameworks under Python. Django is the most representative of the heavyweights. Many successful websites and apps are based on Django.

If you have a little bit of information about your own basics, you can try to get started with the Django blog from abroad to build a series of tutorials . This tutorial is very detailed, and there are many interesting pictures. However, due to the wall, many people will not be able to visit, even if they are interviewed, because they are English, they will not be patiently reading. So I am going to translate this tutorial.

Later, after a friend said, this tutorial has been translated, so I don't translate it, but I feel that my translation is still very good, because it is not a literal translation, it is expressed again in my own language after understanding.

Here are the top translate this tutorial program Github and blog , to see which feel comfortable, you choose which to learn.

Continually updated....
